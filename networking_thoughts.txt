0. Simulation ticks every 20ms, snapshot taken every 5 ticks (100ms). Maximum 
    latency window is 5 snapshots (500ms).

1. Client and server regularly do a three-way ping (ping, pongping, pong) so 
    they both know each other's latency (which is roughly equal). Latency is 
    used to calculate snapshotDelay = latency / snapshotTime.

2. Server sends a snapshot delta every snapshot take. Client receives delta 
    snapshotDelay snapshot's behind present time, so applies to relevant 
    snapshot and reiterates simulation -- client must hold up to latencyWindow
    snapshots for this purpose.

3. Input on the client happens with each tick and sent to the server ASAP.

4. Input from a client is delayed by latency by the time it reaches the server.
    Server must rewind the simulation to the appropriate snapshot and 
    resimulate up to present.
